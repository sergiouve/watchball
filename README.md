# Watchball
The ultimate mix of football and a watch!

Did your child you ever play football with a watch? No?
I'm not surprised, it's not a very exciting game, but here is
is this HTML5 game to change that!

While I finish writing the code here's some basic rules:

- This is a two player turn-based game.
- Stop the time at .00 and you score a goal.
- Stop the time at .99 or .01 and you get to shoot a penatly (Even number is goal, odd number is missed)
- Fouls, cards, animations, fans, stadiums and beers coming...
