WatchBall is a game about accuracy. It's the ultimate mix of football and timing!!! ...Anyways,
to win you must score more goals than your opponent in the given time. The game is turn-based,
in each turn you must try to stop the time at one of the following:

1- .00 => GOAL!
2- .99 OR .01 => Penalty
	2b. Even number => GOAL!
	2c. Odd number => Dude... you missed

- Each round a couple of random numbers will be generated, if you stop in one of those you will recieve a red
  card and your opponent will have two consecutive turns.

	· RED CARD: you will recieve a red card and your opponent will have two consecutive turns until the end 
		of th game.
